## Features
The following features can be used in the project:

- Adding a new collection (bookshelf) and media into bookshelves.
- Editing existing media in bookshelves.
- Viewing existing media in bookshelves without accidentally editing the information.
- Deleting media in bookshelves.
- Deleting bookshelves out of the database.
- Creating PDF files of the bookshelves.

## Future Improvements
The following are features I want to implement at a later date:

- Filter option to filter books only from view.
- Charts of the different genres of each media.
- Chart showing the amount of a type of media relating to the entire collection.
- Better UI with transitions.
- Editing entire bookshelves (to change names, etc).
- Showing the total amount spent on media in the PDF.

## Technology Used
I used the following resources to build storefully:

- Java
- MySQL/MariaDB
- Play Framework
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap 4
- Javascript
- iTextPDF
- Font Awesome (for icons)
